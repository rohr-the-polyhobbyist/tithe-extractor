# Tithe Extractor  
The tithe_extractor library includes functions to request, process, and analyze Scryfall API data.  
  
## Features  
```scryfall_api``` submodule contains functions relavant for pulling data from Scryfall's API.
```datautils``` submodule contains functions for storing, extracting, and parsing card data.
```constants``` submodule contains some constants for pathing/request formatting.

## Installation
You can pip install this package using the ```git+``` tag followed by the path to this repo:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rohr-the-polyhobbyist/tithe-extractor.git
```
Note: the package can be imported in a python environment via:
`import tithe_extractor`
or import submodules/specific functions/variables as needed.
There may be some errors with the pathing... Still sorting out how to best do that.
